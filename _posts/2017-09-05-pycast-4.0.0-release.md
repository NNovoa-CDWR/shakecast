We are excited to anounce that ShakeCast V4 is entering production! This version of ShakeCast is lightweight and should be easier for new users to install than previous versions. Although new features will only be adopted by V4 systems, we'll continue to support V3 users moving forward. For installation instructions and a setup guide, checkout the [pyCast page](pycast_docs.html).
